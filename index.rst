For information on solving a CellML model with a simple numerical solver, please see the :libcellml_doc_page:`solving a generated model page <solver>`.   

Hodgkin-Huxley modelling tutorials
----------------------------------

The second set of tutorials take the user progressively through different aspects of the libCellML functionality while building towards a model of Hodgkin and Huxley's squid axon activation.
It is aimed at users who are already familiar with the concept of CellML and modelling.

For more information on their theoretical background, please see the `Hodgkin-Huxley theory pages <https://libcellml.org/documentation>`_.
